A simple pytorch implementation for: "Soft Filter Pruning for Accelerating Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" IJCAI 2018 (refer to: https://github.com/he-y/soft-filter-pruning), 
and "Filter Pruning via Geometric Median for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Acceleration" CVPR Oral 2019 (refer to: https://github.com/he-y/filter-pruning-geometric-median), 
and "Asymptotic Soft Filter Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" IEEE Trans Cybernetics 2020 (no publicly available original code, following the writing style above)

**TODO:**

- add STBP
